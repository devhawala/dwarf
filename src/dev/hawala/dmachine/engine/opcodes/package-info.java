/**
 * The package {@code dev.hawala.dmachine.engine.opcodes} contains the
 * implementation of the mesa instructions.
 * <p>
 * The instructions are automatically bound to the opcodes using the naming
 * convention defined by the class {@link dev.hawala.dmachine.engine.Opcodes}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The implementations of the instructions are grouped in classes organized along
 * the chapters 3 to 10 of the <i>Mesa Processor Principles of Operation Version
 * 4.0 (May85)</i> document. An additional class (for chapter "XX") holds the instructions
 * that became available after version 4.0 of the PrincOps (being in fact undocumented),
 * as far as these instructions are used.
