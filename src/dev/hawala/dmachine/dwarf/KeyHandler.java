/**
 * Key stroke listener for the Dwarf screen pane, forwarding the key-pressed and
 * key-released event to the keyboard-mapper.
 * <p>
 * Handling diacritical start characters (also called dead keys, for example the
 * accent-grave (forward-tick), accent-aigue (back-tick), accent-circonflex (^) etc.)
 * is a problem under Linux, as modern Linuces think to be smart in prehandling those
 * characters to combine them with the next pressed key: this has the net effect
 * that for a press-release cycle, only the release event arrives in the Java window
 * key listener (using the focus management listening alternative does not help,
 * as even being a level deeper in the event pipeline did not help).
 * <br>
 * This is handled here in a questionable, but seemingly working way: if a key-release
 * event arrives for which the key-pressed is missing, first a synthetic key-pressed
 * event is sent to the keyboard-mapper, and the key-release event is delayed by 50 msecs. 
 * </p>
