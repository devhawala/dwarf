 * for a single mesa engine.
 * <p>
 * These are classes necessary to give the mesa engine as visible interface
 * (black and white display pane for visualizing the mesa display memory,
 * callbacks implementation) as well as the main UI frame window for Dwarf
 * including classes for Java Swing event handling (listeners for keyboard,
 * mouse etc.)
